2011-07-30 15:16:16	We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.

2011-08-01 14:33:34	Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
2011-08-01 15:41:21	This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
2011-08-01 16:58:44	Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.

2011-11-08 20:54:26	Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem.
2011-11-09 14:17:28	Some @OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party.

2011-12-12 20:19:37	If these guys have any integrity they'd say no to MSNBC -- a network that few watch and is very negative. @AndrewBreitbart re debate.
2011-12-12 21:15:55	I was on a tele-townhall with @TeamBachmann and hosted her 4 times in Trump Tower yet she declined the Newsmax-@iontv debate. No loyalty.
2011-12-12 21:31:28	Why did @BarackObama let Iran keep our drone? Now it is going straight to the Chinese. He should have taken it out.
2011-12-12 21:52:24	@BarackObama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 Presidents combined. He is simply out of control.

2011-12-13 17:16:54	Look, here's  the deal: @BarackObama has been a total disaster. He has spent this country into the ground and destroyed jobs #TimeToGetTough
2011-12-13 18:40:27	The Mullahs are laughing at what they think is a very stupid president,@BarackObama has asked for Iran to return the drone #TimeToGetTough

2011-12-14 21:53:48	Iran is closing the Strait of Hormuz for a military exercise. Imagine what they will do with nukes?!
2011-12-14 22:08:19	The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, has sacrificed so much. He is delaying his 17 day Hawaii vacation a couple of hours.

2011-12-19 21:25:24	With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation. Just plain wrong.
2011-12-19 21:28:23	Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday. Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed.
