2019-01-01 00:40:26	MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico &amp, Canada will also thrive - good for all!
2019-01-01 00:51:43	The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech ‚Äústuff‚Äù is just, by comparison, meaningless bells &amp, whistles...
2019-01-01 01:05:39	...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!

2019-01-01 14:25:32	Happy New Year!
2019-01-01 14:32:01	The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!

These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but can‚Äôt because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!
2019-01-02 12:53:55	Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn‚Äôt. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player &amp, WIN!
2019-01-02 13:35:30	Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!

For them, strictly politics!

2019-01-04 13:16:20	How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?

2019-01-05 12:57:17	The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!
2019-01-05 13:55:41	Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama &amp, the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &amp, settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!
2019-01-05 14:48:55	I don‚Äôt care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?
2019-01-05 15:16:14	We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.
2019-01-05 15:54:42	The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they don‚Äôt want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!

In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 &amp, 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!
2019-01-12 14:47:04	Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
2019-01-12 15:57:23	I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is ‚Äúchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.‚Äù The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, there‚Äôs almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...
2019-01-12 16:07:22	....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!
2019-01-12 16:14:55	We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their ‚Äúvacations‚Äù and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!

2019-01-13 14:58:26	Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don‚Äôt want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch!
2019-01-13 15:00:53	The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!
2019-01-13 15:05:37	I‚Äôm in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!
2019-01-13 15:36:04	The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!
2019-01-13 15:45:45	Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons. Most came through our Southern Border. We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall. Walls Work! John Jones, Texas Department of Public Safety.  @FoxNews
2019-01-13 22:01:21	Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE!
2019-01-13 22:53:32	Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone....
2019-01-13 23:02:56	....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!
2019-01-14 01:45:10	So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.

2019-01-20 12:59:35	Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn‚Äôt be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!
2019-01-20 13:11:51	Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don‚Äôt see crime &amp, drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country &amp, allow people to go back to work.
2019-01-20 13:23:28	No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy!
2019-01-20 13:35:46	Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally &amp, has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‚Äúlefties‚Äù in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!
2019-01-20 13:51:26	Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, I‚Äôll get back to you soon!
2019-01-20 14:03:26	Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.
2019-01-20 14:20:57	Don‚Äôt forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!

2019-01-31 12:41:56	China‚Äôs top trade negotiators are in the U.S. meeting with our representatives. Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. They are correct. I will be......
2019-01-31 12:48:13	....meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction....
2019-01-31 12:56:36	....China‚Äôs representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal, leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table. All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved. Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st, so all working hard to complete by that date!
2019-01-31 13:21:01	Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I‚Äôve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don‚Äôt expect much help!
2019-01-31 13:36:29	Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!
2019-01-31 14:52:17	More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals, through large Caravans, into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans, and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!
2019-01-31 14:56:15	Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services, which they are now doing, but also to our Manufacturing, Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!
2019-01-31 15:08:03	Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!

2019-02-03 09:59:03	With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country, Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall, there is no Security. Human Trafficking, Drugs and Criminals of all dimensionns - KEEP OUT!

2019-02-09 22:54:05	Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!

2019-02-27 02:31:21	Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!

2019-03-01 12:49:22	Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, let‚Äôs see what happens!
2019-03-01 13:00:17	Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a ‚Äúlove letter to Trump‚Äù manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!
2019-03-01 13:08:02	Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen‚Äôs new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions  against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!
2019-03-01 13:19:44	Oh‚Äô I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, ‚Äúgee, I have an idea, let‚Äôs look at Trump‚Äôs finances and every deal he has ever done. Let‚Äôs follow discredited Michael Cohen.....
2019-03-01 13:26:56	...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it‚Äôs time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!
2019-03-01 13:37:09	Michael Cohen‚Äôs book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
2019-03-01 21:03:13	I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....

2019-03-03 20:18:23	The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!

2019-03-28 10:13:14	The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major ‚Äúbreakdown,‚Äù have ZERO credibility or respect, &amp, must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday, I will tell you the secret!
2019-03-28 10:24:04	Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems don‚Äôt care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!
2019-03-28 10:34:34	FBI &amp, DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!
2019-03-28 10:43:13	Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!
2019-03-28 11:04:04	Wow, ratings for ‚ÄúMorning Joe,‚Äù which were really bad in the first place, just ‚Äútanked‚Äù with the release of the Mueller Report. Likewise, other shows on MSNBC and CNN have gone down by as much as 50%. Just shows, Fake News never wins!

2019-03-28 19:51:49	We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration &amp, drugs!

2019-03-29 15:23:50	The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, &amp, they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, &amp, Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....
2019-03-29 15:37:09	....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn‚Äôt immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING.....
2019-03-29 15:43:46	....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and ‚Äútalk.‚Äù Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!
2019-03-29 21:41:20	Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, &amp, Stock Market, would have both been much higher &amp, World Markets would be in a better place!
2019-03-29 22:31:49	Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the ‚Äúinsurance policy‚Äù statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth.....
2019-03-29 23:15:44	...The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass &amp, Complain &amp, Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, we‚Äôve got a Country to run!
2019-03-29 23:25:17	So funny that The New York Times &amp, The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!

2019-03-30 20:31:22	It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems don‚Äôt care about the crime, they don‚Äôt want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!
2019-03-30 20:36:30	Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp, we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!
2019-03-30 22:24:34	‚ÄúThe Trump Administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to Iran for its sinister behavior, at no cost to the U.S. or our allies.

2019-03-31 19:21:24	Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion, No Obstruction Trump Campaign began. We need to know for future generations to understand. This Hoax should never be allowed to happen to another President or Administration again!
2019-03-31 19:39:13	‚ÄúOutrageous, it‚Äôs the Adam Schiff problem. People abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn‚Äôt prove to be true. You look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival. Who made it?‚Äù James Freeman, @WSJ
2019-03-31 23:41:52	The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING, a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice, but not for long!
2019-04-01 12:07:45	Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released, most Democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exists!
2019-04-01 12:13:29	Democrats, working with Republicans in Congress, can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!

2019-04-01 13:03:28	Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!
2019-04-01 13:41:23	The cost of ObamaCare is far too high for our great citizens. The deductibles, in many cases way over $7000, make it almost worthless or unusable. Good things are going to happen! @SenRickScott  @senatemajldr @SenJohnBarrasso  @SenBillCassidy
2019-04-01 14:43:14	No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!
2019-04-01 16:47:16	Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdue‚Äôs disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!
2019-04-02 02:13:25	Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn‚Äôt work. Premiums &amp, deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.....
2019-04-02 02:23:55	....are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) &amp, deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive &amp, much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp, win......
2019-04-02 02:37:44	....back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also, Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime, the USA is doing better than ever &amp, is respected again!
2019-04-02 02:50:20	The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any ‚Äúplace‚Äù in history. The people of Puerto Rico.....
2019-04-02 03:11:44	....are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp, Florida combined, yet their government can‚Äôt do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works. FEMA &amp, the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like.....
2019-04-02 03:38:29	....the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!
2019-04-02 11:33:17	Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp, all their local politicians do is complain &amp, ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp, only take from USA....
2019-04-02 11:45:26	....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!
2019-04-02 11:58:10	In 1998, Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM! @foxandfriends

Now the Dems don‚Äôt even acknowledge his name, have become totally unhinged, and would like to go through the whole process again. It won‚Äôt happen!
2019-04-02 12:54:11	There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
2019-04-02 14:41:50	After many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!

It will be on full display during the Election as a much better &amp, less expensive alternative to ObamaCare...
2019-04-03 13:37:14	...This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
2019-04-03 13:45:03	Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action, Border, or large sections of Border, will close. This is a National Emergency!

2019-04-04 12:22:54	According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started - so illegal!
2019-04-04 12:46:27	There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!
2019-04-04 15:04:27	The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

2019-04-05 13:04:12	The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop.......
2019-04-05 13:11:36	....However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn‚Äôt work, which it will, I will close the Border.......
2019-04-05 13:19:46	....This will supersede USMCA. Likewise I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!

2019-04-18 23:46:58	When there is not an underlying crime with regard to Collusion (in fact, the whole thing was a made up fraud), it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something. There was no underlying crime.‚Äù @marthamaccallum  @FoxNews

2019-04-24 04:48:54	Rep. Occasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great. But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice &amp, Accountability passed. ‚ÄúPresident Trump deserves a lot of credit.‚Äù Dan Caldwell, Concerned Veterans of America
2019-04-24 11:04:17	‚ÄúFormer CIA analyst Larry Johnson accuses United Kingdom Intelligence of helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign.‚Äù @OANN WOW! It is now just a question of time before the truth comes out, and when it does, it will be a beauty!
2019-04-24 11:18:08	The American people deserve to know who is in this Country. Yesterday, the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question, a really big deal. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2019-04-24 11:25:43	A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border &amp, call up the Military. The Coyotes &amp, Cartels have weapons!
2019-04-24 12:00:46	Mexico‚Äôs Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers, probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending &amp, returning!
2019-04-24 12:10:06	The Mueller Report, despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didn‚Äôt lay a glove on me. I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court. Not only......
2019-04-24 12:18:31	.....are there no ‚ÄúHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors,‚Äù there are no Crimes by me at all. All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops - and we caught them in the act! We waited for Mueller and WON, so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope!
2019-04-24 13:34:41	Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418,000 plus illegal immigrants, way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!
2019-04-24 13:47:54	No Collusion, No Obstruction - there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent. Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems, plus I allowed everyone to testify, including W.H. counsel. I didn‚Äôt have to do this, but now they want more.....
2019-04-24 13:52:04	....Congress has no time to legislate, they only want to continue the Witch Hunt, which I have already won. They should start looking at The Criminals who are already very well known to all. This was a Rigged System - WE WILL DRAIN THE SWAMP!
2019-04-24 14:09:35	I didn‚Äôt call Bob Costa of the Washington Post, he called me (Returned his call)!  Just more Fake News.

If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn‚Äôt need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself. Nevertheless,....
2019-04-25 11:57:24	....Mueller was NOT fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I, and many others, say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime), headed by a Trump hater who was highly conflicted, and a group of 18 VERY ANGRY Democrats. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
2019-04-25 12:09:42	.....Despite the fact that the Mueller Report was ‚Äúcomposed‚Äù by Trump Haters and Angry Democrats, who had unlimited funds and human resources, the end result was No Collusion, No Obstruction. Amazing!
2019-04-25 12:22:18	Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign.

2019-04-26 11:12:21	No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else. This is not the Obama Administration that paid 1.8 Billion Dollars for four hostages, or gave five terroist hostages plus, who soon went back to battle, for traitor Sgt. Bergdahl!
2019-04-26 11:32:40	‚ÄúPresident Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages, many in impossible circumstances, have been released in last two years. No money was paid.‚Äù Cheif Hostage Negotiator, USA!

2019-04-29 12:18:25	The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the State‚Äôs legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, &amp, others.

2019-05-14 10:51:41	We can make a deal with China tomorrow, before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business, but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.....

My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.....
2019-05-14 11:29:35	....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù for many years. Their time is now!
2019-05-14 11:29:35	Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy......

2019-05-14 12:35:41	China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‚Äúmatch,‚Äù it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!

2019-08-30 12:54:41	The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!

2019-09-06 14:29:46	The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said, at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian, that in addition to Florida &amp, other states, Alabama may also be grazed or hit. They went Crazy, hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn‚Äôt). Check out maps.....
