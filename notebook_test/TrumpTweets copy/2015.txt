2015-04-28 02:02:46	Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast! Thugs must be stopped.
2015-04-28 04:28:15	Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
2015-04-28 04:38:12	Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
2015-04-28 09:59:08	Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
2015-04-28 10:14:57	The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy - another real genius!
2015-04-28 11:31:24	@Vanderpunked: Can we drop @realDonaldTrump off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done? I would fix it fast!
2015-04-28 11:50:31	Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking,  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
2015-04-28 11:55:42	President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done! Do it.
2015-04-28 13:03:54	The best social program, by far, is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.
2015-04-29 00:33:28	Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm, be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!
2015-04-29 07:49:07	I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?

2015-06-25 14:26:52	Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation &amp, horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!
2015-06-25 14:27:20	Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U.S. makes with Mexico.
2015-06-25 14:27:45	I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them. Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.
2015-06-26 14:06:22	Once again the Bush appointed  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!
2015-06-26 14:07:44	Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision.
2015-06-26 15:13:06	.@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S.  Are they controlled by the Mexican government?
2015-06-26 16:38:33	If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.

2015-07-13 04:05:42	The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our leaders can't say no!
2015-07-13 10:47:36	El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a  vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the U.S.
2015-07-13 10:53:14	....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border. We get the killers, drugs &amp, crime, they get the money!

2015-07-18 17:59:14	In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!

2015-07-18 18:15:12	The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
2015-07-18 18:15:19	....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
2015-07-18 18:15:36	All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
2015-07-18 18:15:49	I will make this right for our great Vets!
2015-07-18 18:16:26	It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
2015-07-18 18:16:32	....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
2015-07-18 18:51:48	I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.

2015-08-21 13:56:00	How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. This must stop. Unaffordable and not right!
2015-08-21 14:32:43	We are going to have a wild time in Alabama tonight! Finally, the silent majority is back! http://t.co/Vj8vho1ro7
2015-08-21 15:25:01	Great! https://t.co/oJ6sqHB3MA
2015-08-21 15:35:18	@AmyMek Every Time I see @realDonaldTrump address a crowd I want to start chanting USA, USA, USA! #AmericanPride is Back #Trump2016
2015-08-21 16:35:21	Boston incident is terrible. We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. I would never condone violence.
2015-08-21 20:01:32	Leaving for Mobile, Alabama, right now - can't be late!
2015-08-21 20:06:26	Dow dives more than 500 points - down 9% from high. Be careful!

2015-08-22 11:58:08	Alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks  was largest crowd of political season. Nice!
2015-08-22 19:38:58	@crstin0516: @DanScavino @keraladubai @realDonaldTrump That chant gave me sweet, sweet chills!! #USA üá∫üá∏ #America
2015-08-22 19:39:40	@dojiedojie: @realDonaldTrump Keep talking Donald....The people want to hear it loud and clear!!!!!
2015-08-22 19:44:38	.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. They go out of their way to distort truth!
2015-08-22 20:13:21	I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000. But said Bernie  Sanders had 11,000 in same room.
2015-08-22 20:18:59	Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive  story on my speech in Alabama last night. It was a great evening!
2015-08-22 20:23:47	How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad!
2015-08-22 20:28:50	It has just been confirmed by  the City of Mobile, Alabama, that there were 30,000 people at last nights event, making it  #1for pol season.
2015-08-22 21:22:03	Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally  speaking up. Just politicians!
2015-08-22 22:19:05	Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
2015-08-22 22:27:37	Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. Jeb just can't get it right!
2015-08-23 10:39:52	The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House. Would be the same old thing (remember read my lips, no more taxes). GREATNESS!
2015-08-23 11:01:19	New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2015-08-24 13:30:48	As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down. Get smart U.S.A.
2015-08-24 13:38:59	@john_franco: When people start losing their savings &amp, home value, they will be begging Trump to fix the economy #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
2015-08-24 13:43:13	Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.
2015-08-24 13:44:39	@ZephyrusMatrix: Will you finally get respect for predicting U.S. concerns even weeks before disaster strikes.The country needs a visionary
2015-08-24 13:45:31	@glendabelle_11 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters- volunteer ,contribute, assist campaign etc .We need Trump

2015-08-25 01:42:42	.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration!
2015-08-25 01:50:30	I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
2015-08-25 01:55:15	@ColeHudson68: @megynkelly  @FoxNews @theBlaze @greta @OreillyFactor Megyn needs to go back on vacation. What a waste of an hour on Fox.

2015-08-25 02:14:54	@YoungYoung54:  @JeriHyatt @megynkelly @JebBush So true. Jeb Bush is crazy, who cares that he speaks Mexican, this is America, English !!
2015-08-25 02:15:44	@PatrickStinard: @megynkelly Kelly File was much better without Megyn Kelly. Her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better!
2015-08-25 02:57:09	Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation. Go Jeb!
2015-08-25 10:49:06	In a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed ASIANS
2015-08-25 10:52:28	Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. A mess!
2015-08-25 12:39:01	Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence. It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!
2015-08-25 12:49:42	.@GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York. If he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide. He and Graham ZERO in polls
2015-08-25 12:53:57	@ibemoshing: No hope for Jeb Bush anymore, @realDonaldTrump has been on fire! Really hope he can get the win and fix this country!
2015-08-25 12:54:31	@Dlund22226523: Gov. Scott Walker has ran Wisconsin's economy into the ground. How dare he criticize you. You would fire him in a second.

2015-09-05 11:56:51	.@MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!
2015-09-05 12:05:31	The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast,  before it is too late!
2015-09-05 12:14:11	Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical gotcha questions
2015-09-05 12:20:39	Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN. He is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy!
2015-09-05 12:28:21	Just announced that because of Trump, advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?
2015-09-05 21:33:28	Saudi Arabia was vehemently against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse?
2015-09-05 21:36:41	Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black
2015-09-05 21:42:32	Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches!
2015-09-05 21:46:47	Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED
2015-09-05 21:50:25	By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
2015-09-05 21:54:41	The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class!

2015-09-06 20:11:43	The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites!
2015-09-06 20:24:00	Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!
2015-09-06 20:28:01	The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success. Tickets are going FAST!
2015-09-06 20:37:32	I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran.

2015-09-07 19:35:32	Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events. D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
2015-09-07 20:25:19	Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!
2015-09-08 15:22:51	Look forward to being in DC tomorrow‚Äîbig crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
2015-09-08 15:24:48	Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol. Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.

2015-09-15 17:46:43	My plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes‚Äîjust another lie.
2015-09-15 17:47:53	.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. I said no. Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes. I‚Äôll lower big league for middle class.
2015-09-15 17:53:03	Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night. Spectacular crowd &amp, arena! Thank you @mcuban.
2015-09-15 18:00:34	The polls are really looking good‚Äî#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist &amp, special interest $ being spent against me. I‚Äôm turning down millions.
2015-09-15 18:39:28	.@rushlimbaugh Rush, I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) &amp, listening to you. You are truly fantastic--thanks!
2015-09-16 02:39:02	Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa. VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me. Such a great honor, thank you!
2015-09-16 03:18:05	I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!
2015-09-16 04:41:25	@97Musick: @AC360 @CNN The sold to lobbyists candidates are wasting their money. ON the BORDER and IMMIGRATION, Trump WILL win.
2015-09-16 04:42:10	@almy23841665: @DlSCORD @realDonaldTrump More Veterans will vote for Trump than you can believe! I can't imagine they wouldn't!

2015-09-16 04:47:02	@PMgeezer: Only 15 percent of @GOP voters said they would not back @realDonaldTrump as the party‚Äôs standard-bearer. http://t.co/hqt7WXTepm
2015-09-16 04:49:32	@skulls2001: We are a Cuban family from Miami Florida and would love very much to work on your political campaing here in Miami. Great.
2015-09-16 06:16:39	@onesoldiersmom: @seanhannity @MarkSteynOnline  No one can imitate Trump. He's one of a kind. I love him more each day. #Trump2016  Thanks
2015-09-16 20:03:56	Will be heading over to the debate soon. Can you believe @CNN is milking it for almost 3 hours? Too long, too many people on stage!
2015-09-16 20:10:05	A great honor from somebody that knows how to win! https://t.co/syJH9OT0zX

2015-09-19 12:45:57	Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!
2015-09-19 12:52:27	This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
2015-09-19 12:58:08	If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!
2015-09-19 13:19:25	If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!
2015-09-19 13:37:14	Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great
2015-09-19 19:15:11	On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!

2015-09-20 13:17:28	I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?
2015-09-21 00:30:07	There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
2015-09-21 00:51:49	I have been leading big in all  polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next,  at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
2015-09-21 00:56:52	I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.   Much of the media is totally dishonest. So sad!
2015-09-21 00:59:16	We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!
2015-09-21 01:34:00	Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer! Pres.
2015-09-21 03:22:58	@SaijoSaijo75: @realDonaldTrump thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again!
2015-09-21 11:32:57	Will be on @foxandfriends  now. Enjoy!
2015-09-21 12:28:14	The @TODAYshow refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used @CNN numbers where my lead is smaller.
2015-09-21 12:29:46	@MNTwisterChaser: Thanks @SavannahGuthrie and @NBCNews for showing us how lopsided you are! Use your own poll! #trainwreck #Trump2016
2015-09-21 12:30:38	@PaulkDebra: @TODAYshow @realDonaldTrump I totally support you! You have this Ga. Girl's vote!!!
2015-09-21 12:32:07	@TheBrodyFile: On the Muslim issue: It might help @BarackObama if he didn't take five years to visit Israel
2015-09-21 12:32:47	@TheBrodyFile: On the Muslim issue: It might help @BarackObama if he actually supported Christians religious liberty rights.

2015-09-21 12:38:36	@mickelsenkyle: @TODAYshow could you make your interview with @realDonaldTrump any more biased or... #TrumpForPresident
2015-09-21 12:39:23	@linley4067_jane: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Fox is using you for ratings. They want u out of the race. Refuse.
2015-09-21 12:39:46	@alivelutheran: @TODAYshow touts CNN polls instead of their own!! Of course, the NBC one shows him much higher. Trump corrects them!

2015-09-23 02:07:58	I think @megynkelly should take another eleven day unscheduled vacation.
2015-09-23 02:16:44	Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!

2015-11-01 13:58:31	Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight.
2015-11-01 14:03:53	If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!

2015-11-06 02:32:14	The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!

2015-11-06 09:59:21	@rhinostate: .@realDonaldTrump @GrundleMan27 Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate. People will own him if he ever became president.
2015-11-06 11:58:25	Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.
2015-11-06 12:16:29	Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead. But I am #1, easily! Sad
2015-11-06 14:08:17	With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
2015-11-06 14:08:41	Carson now admits his friend named Bob, who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!
2015-11-06 14:48:35	I think it would be a good idea‚Äîand fair‚Äîto include @GovChristie &amp, @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate. Both solid &amp, good guys. @FoxBusiness

2015-11-12 11:41:07	.@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later.
2015-11-12 11:45:47	The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.
2015-11-12 11:51:38	When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want smart trade deals.
2015-11-12 12:23:14	Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
2015-11-12 12:50:11	We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!

2015-11-16 00:57:48	.@JohnLegere  @TMobile  John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.
2015-11-16 01:03:21	President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO!
2015-11-16 01:09:01	Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!
2015-11-16 01:10:58	@StreetR77:  @JohnLegere @TMobile didn't know he was CEO of tmobile, I have T-Mobile, it's pathetic, dropped calls, no service.

2015-11-16 12:43:30	Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.

2015-11-16 18:47:19	Wow, @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year. I never knew my ties &amp, shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact!

2015-11-17 13:19:03	I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat
2015-11-17 13:54:30	Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane?

2015-11-17 20:48:53	.@AP is doing very badly. I can say from experience their reporting is terrible &amp, highly inaccurate. Sadly, they are now irrelevant!

2015-11-19 13:11:49	Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG &amp, BEAUTIFUL WALL!
2015-11-19 16:30:16	Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration &amp, the wall. After Paris, they‚Äôre all on the bandwagon.

2015-11-19 21:34:39	The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it!
2015-11-20 01:04:55	Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign &amp, debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
2015-11-20 01:05:16	John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
2015-11-20 01:05:35	John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
2015-11-20 01:05:54	I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don‚Äôt want to waste my money.
2015-11-20 01:06:04	Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
2015-11-20 01:06:15	Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
2015-11-20 01:06:28	I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy‚Äîhe came in dead last!
2015-11-20 01:06:49	Doesn‚Äôt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he‚Äôs almost last.
2015-11-20 01:06:59	John Kasich fell right into President Obama‚Äôs trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
2015-11-20 01:47:31	Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete &amp, total dud!
2015-11-20 01:55:47	John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
2015-11-20 02:28:38	A great evening in Iowa! Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum! #Trump2016 #IAForums https://t.co/092t2VrMEw

2015-11-20 12:50:14	The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders MASTERMINDS. Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
2015-11-20 13:00:30	The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!
2015-11-20 14:30:27	Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday!
2015-11-20 15:03:04	.@mkhammer, a Fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @TheJuanWilliams made the point far better!

2015-11-26 01:29:29	The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
2015-11-26 01:35:50	The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb
2015-11-26 01:41:15	So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent!

2015-12-15 14:47:56	Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it
2015-12-15 14:54:17	Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press
2015-12-15 15:30:25	.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!
2015-12-15 15:34:25	.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
2015-12-15 15:40:47	I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!

2015-12-22 22:39:11	Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!
2015-12-22 22:50:23	Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
2015-12-23 00:47:59	Once again, #MSM is dishonest. Schlonged is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly.
2015-12-23 00:48:24	NPR's @NealConan said schlonged to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls. #Hypocrisy
2015-12-23 00:52:12	For those on TV defending my use of the word schlonged, bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
2015-12-23 02:59:33	Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!

2015-12-23 03:37:51	When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!
2015-12-23 05:48:08	It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
2015-12-23 06:02:10	We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
2015-12-23 12:02:24	Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10

2015-12-23 14:20:57	The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
2015-12-23 14:40:52	The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/wBdSg5ab25
2015-12-23 14:55:24	The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad
2015-12-23 15:49:01	.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
2015-12-23 15:55:23	Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
2015-12-23 17:20:55	It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
2015-12-23 23:17:09	Hillary, when you complain about a penchant for sexism, who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!
2015-12-24 01:57:28	Merry Christmas &amp, Happy Holidays!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016https://t.co/XIVw5LdTqv https://t.co/Sqim2YyoCH
2015-12-24 03:22:59	Hillary said I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity
2015-12-24 03:25:20	@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal.  Good question!
2015-12-24 14:53:19	@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal.

2015-12-24 20:02:02	@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail
2015-12-24 20:10:14	Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
2015-12-24 22:14:10	In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
2015-12-24 22:20:24	Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
2015-12-24 22:31:41	Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
2015-12-24 22:35:38	Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
2015-12-24 22:42:10	Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
2015-12-24 22:56:55	Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
2015-12-24 23:04:08	.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
2015-12-24 23:28:54	I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2015-12-25 01:50:38	@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story  True, a total distortion of the facts!
2015-12-25 01:56:08	.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
2015-12-25 02:22:42	.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
2015-12-25 02:55:58	Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
2015-12-25 19:38:17	.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
2015-12-25 20:11:18	Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
2015-12-25 20:15:25	We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
2015-12-25 20:24:41	Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
2015-12-25 20:31:40	Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
2015-12-25 20:45:06	When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it? Never!
2015-12-25 20:49:55	@ClassySnobbb: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm reading #CrippledAmerica! Best book ever. Thank you!
2015-12-25 20:51:33	@Jacobsac2015:  @FoxNews Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas. Can't wait to see you as President, Mr. Trump. You are awesome.
2015-12-25 20:52:03	@JodiL792:  You know what's making my Christmas Great, Family/food/friends&amp,YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America
2015-12-25 20:55:35	@deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice!
2015-12-25 21:11:23	@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!
2015-12-25 21:42:39	.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
2015-12-25 21:49:30	The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
2015-12-26 13:00:26	The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it
2015-12-26 14:11:40	Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!

2015-12-26 23:47:29	@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive
2015-12-27 00:31:07	Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
2015-12-27 02:05:01	Thank you! #Trump2016https://t.co/CE9f0mukFm https://t.co/XNV9Bg2ccY
2015-12-27 03:05:19	I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
2015-12-27 12:37:24	@Sir_Max: andreajmarkley: Rubio finally gets an endorsement ‚Äì from #Benghazi loser Gowdy #Tcot #pjnet https://t.co/lJcHG0IHaM via dailyne
2015-12-27 12:45:25	@mitchellvii: Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi. He allowed it to drag out and in the end, let Hillary get away with murder.
2015-12-27 12:45:41	@mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy.
2015-12-27 12:46:42	@CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him.
2015-12-27 16:04:38	It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!
2015-12-27 16:19:51	R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!
2015-12-27 16:25:35	The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!
2015-12-27 16:49:55	.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!
2015-12-27 16:59:15	Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC
2015-12-28 03:03:29	Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!
2015-12-28 03:05:04	@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!  Thank you.
2015-12-28 12:12:10	If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
2015-12-28 12:30:43	The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD
2015-12-28 12:42:06	Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!
2015-12-28 12:50:23	Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!
2015-12-28 13:34:30	Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double &amp, triple them, a disaster!

2015-12-29 14:39:30	So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp, done. Run country my way!

2015-12-30 00:36:45	Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
2015-12-30 00:37:11	The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
2015-12-30 00:37:25	Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.
