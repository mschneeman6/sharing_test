2014-01-08 22:12:54	Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama? The fact is, Iraq etc. have always been disasters!

2014-03-27 23:36:12	Autism WAY UP - I believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots. Too much for small child to handle. Govt. should stop NOW!
2014-03-27 23:39:24	@ctsa: @realDonaldTrump when I was a kid, there were 8. Now they give upwards of 31-40. It's an assault on the immune system.
2014-03-27 23:44:11	If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - AUTISM.
2014-03-27 23:44:26	@Bossman140: @realDonaldTrump the most brilliant observation you have ever made. Parents should take your advice

2014-03-28 17:34:26	@SamJabbo  @realDonaldTrump i haven't read any of your books yet, which one should i start with? The Art of the Deal is a good start.
2014-03-28 18:26:27	For Entrepreneurs: A good question to ask yourself –“What can I provide that does not yet exist?”
2014-03-28 18:27:12	Entrepreneurs:  Another question to ask yourself—“What am I pretending not to see?” There may be great opportunities right around you.
2014-03-28 18:27:52	Entrepreneurs:  Believe in yourself. If you don’t, no one else will either. Realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
2014-03-28 19:28:09	@realMikePalumbo  Walked in Trump Tower for the first time this week.. Gorgeous (as all your work). Love the Trump experience  Thank you.

2014-03-29 19:02:52	.@ArsenioHall - The only thing you don't mention in the nice Esquire piece about you is The Apprentice, without which you would be nowhere!
2014-03-29 19:06:52	.@ArsenioHall - How quickly people forget, but not me! You told me that without The Apprentice you could never have gotten your show - Sad!
2014-03-29 19:12:04	@TarrKoziara: @realDonaldTrump @ArsenioHall The Apprentice has started and revived a lot of people's careers.  Very true!
2014-03-29 19:12:45	@AlexArancio: @ArsenioHall doesn't mention Apprentice because his ego won't let him. It's why he failed originally and will fail again
2014-03-29 19:15:51	@tx_shaun: @realDonaldTrump its true, he didn't get his show until after he won the apprentice

2014-03-30 00:30:21	@Winger23: Obamacare has ruined healthcare. Everyone I know is having a hard time paying their new plans. It costs too much!
2014-03-30 00:32:03	@diverojalv: @realDonaldTrump @chrispilz my only concern w/Trump running for prez is that he could only serve two terms!  Very cute!

2014-06-13 08:21:02	@Annmajkrzak: @AP  @cbschicago I like the Trump Logo on the building! I feel this is a personal fight! &amp, will this fight cost IL residents

2014-06-14 23:17:28	Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.
2014-06-14 23:49:37	Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
2014-06-14 23:56:46	Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country &amp, oil, and O will say thanks
2014-06-15 00:10:06	I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
2014-06-15 00:18:49	@dcolon2112: @realDonaldTrump Watching the #USOpen It's as if they're playing on a local community golf course! Looks awful!

2014-06-15 02:09:25	.@MattGinellaGC  It's true Matt, the NEW Blue Monster is better than Pinehurst, so is Bedminster. Turnberry &amp, Trump Aberdeen blow it away!
2014-06-15 02:18:48	.@MattGinellaGC Matt, the statement about Pinehurst looking like a local community golf course,awful, was not made by me but tweeted to me
2014-06-15 02:23:39	@dcolon2112: @RAW1183 It was my comment not @realdonaldtrump I've played on nicer par 3 courses than #USOpen
2014-06-15 02:28:02	.@MattGinellaGC  Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland. Both far better than Pinehurst!
2014-06-15 02:30:45	@ChristianL2499: @realDonaldTrump You're the man Mr. Trump! #DonaldTrump2016 Thanks.

2014-06-15 22:19:18	@GolfDigestMag  Big news from Scotland on Turnberry (which, by the way, blows Pinehurst away!) tomorrow morning. Stay tuned.
2014-06-15 22:30:49	@jshamie:  @GolfDigestMag couldn't agree more. The course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would. BORING FINISH!!!
2014-06-15 22:31:13	@timgerzabek: @realDonaldTrump @GolfDigestMag I thought this was the US Open not the wanna be British Open
2014-06-15 22:31:54	@MarkMoreland: It's worse for @PinehurstResort. I know I wouldn't pay $400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course.
2014-06-15 22:35:26	@epowell88:  Worked @ restaurant for 33 yrs &amp, got fired because they didn't think I could keep up. No severance! Would u do that? NO WAY!
2014-06-15 22:38:35	@MomMom: Just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass. You gave him a reward....good job Donald! Thanks
2014-06-15 22:40:11	@foossh:@GolfDigestMag @realDonaldTrump he has a point, fairways should be green. Scruff can be as bad as you want. Wouldn't pay top dollar
2014-06-15 22:44:33	I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. This is not what golf is about!
2014-06-15 22:49:12	@Robert_W_GA: @realDonaldTrump they think the course should be old school, you know, like before lawn care technology aka goats!
2014-06-15 22:50:47	@aec4444: @realDonaldTrump please don't let the USGA ruin your course in 2017 like they did Pinehurst.  I won't!
2014-06-15 22:51:20	@jackhennessy12: @realDonaldTrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg? True!
2014-06-15 22:51:36	@Mikeyy84: @realDonaldTrump very subdue atmosphere. Not take it away from Kaymer but it's like watching paint dry #USOpen #anticlimax
2014-06-15 23:19:00	Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be redone
2014-06-15 23:31:14	@MattGinellaGC  My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!
2014-06-15 23:35:06	@MattGinellaGC  I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league
2014-06-15 23:40:35	@MattGinellaGCSadly Matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst
2014-06-15 23:46:03	@aec4444: @realDonaldTrump I've played Pinehurst and Trump Bedminster and Donald has 2 in Bedminister that are superior.  Thank you &amp, true
2014-06-15 23:53:43	@ClarkSmidt: Sir Donald. Rather than promote golf courses, please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our Country.

2014-06-15 23:57:59	@CharlieMaikis: @realDonaldTrump I completely agree with DT here. Pinehurst looks bad. I wouldn't pay $400 to play if it looked like that.
2014-06-16 00:02:32	@rink914: @IanJamesPoulter  Actually agree...it may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on TV..I love golf..couldn't watch
2014-06-16 00:16:49	@MattGinellaGC  Matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. You are all talk, no substance!
2014-06-16 00:20:51	@g3stover: @MattGinellaGC is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with @realDonaldTrump  I can beat him in golf even easier!

2014-06-16 00:31:47	@ic @MattGinellaGC stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions. DonaldTrump is 10,000 times more successful than you.
2014-06-16 00:37:08	@MattGinellaGC   Matt, how many club championships have you won? I hear zero, or 18 fewer than me! Lets play for a lot?
2014-06-16 00:39:44	@welsh @realDonaldTrump you have made some great courses, but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course! I agree!
2014-06-16 00:41:08	@ichicagoscott: @realDonaldTrump it was nice of you to give @MattGinellaGC 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had.  I agree!
2014-06-16 01:22:08	@TedatACA: I concur with @realDonaldTrump on Pinehurst. IMO: Those blasts from sandy areas looked like IEDs exploding In Kandahar Province.
2014-06-16 01:25:40	@benSEXT0N: @Cfeetsrevenge @LukeDonald @realDonaldTrump course didn't look good in HD just saying  No, it looked terrible, bad for golf!

2014-10-09 20:49:36	Obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to Liberia to contract Ebola. He is a delusional failure.
2014-10-09 21:05:39	The CDC chief just said Ebola is spreading faster than Aids. Marines are preparing for a pandemic drill. Stop all flights from West Africa!

2014-10-24 02:31:24	I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa. So simple, but he refused. A TOTAL incompetent!
2014-10-24 03:43:33	I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!
2014-10-24 03:54:09	President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!
2014-10-24 04:10:29	President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!

2014-11-24 19:45:44	Congratulations to Chuck Hagel on one of the shortest tenures as Sec. of Defense. Another terrible appointee by Obama.

2014-11-24 20:17:46	Rated @GolfMagazine as 1 of the top courses in the country, Trump Int’l Palm Beach has been expanded to 27 holes http://t.co/vq05peRfXO
2014-11-24 20:32:23	Premiering on January 4th, the 14th season of @ApprenticeNBC will have major fireworks every episode. The Board Room is electric!
2014-11-24 20:48:00	Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.
2014-11-24 21:30:18	There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
2014-11-24 21:38:39	ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
2014-11-24 23:47:00	Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
2014-11-24 23:51:43	Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
2014-11-25 03:40:23	@D_Mellette: @realDonaldTrump for president 2k16
2014-11-25 03:41:07	@Abdul_Akbarzai1:  @TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed
2014-11-25 03:41:43	@TheRealZach49: This is why we need @realDonaldTrump in office. @BarackObama doesn't know how to keep order
2014-11-25 03:47:14	Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader, this would not be the case
2014-11-25 07:45:56	If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
2014-11-25 07:57:16	Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
2014-11-25 08:07:45	As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
2014-11-25 08:15:23	Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
2014-11-25 08:25:13	Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
2014-11-25 08:35:06	Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
