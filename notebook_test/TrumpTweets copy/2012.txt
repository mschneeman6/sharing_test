2012-08-16 19:41:34	There are only 22 days for @BarackObama to drop @JoeBiden. Obama is not a loyal guy. I think he is strongly considering it.

2012-08-28 13:37:25	Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer &amp, felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!
2012-08-28 13:59:45	As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines &amp, ratings!
2012-08-28 14:19:49	The US Navy wants to go green. Our Navy should use the best &amp, most powerful fuel &amp, not play games. Give me a break!
2012-08-28 14:27:55	.@FinancialTimes writes that @BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US  http://t.co/kAeMtnLg Don't worry, he is making it happen.
2012-08-28 14:54:06	.@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
2012-08-28 15:51:55	Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow.
2012-08-28 16:02:49	The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges, etc

2012-08-28 19:19:37	.@GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney  should be elected and @BarackObama has to go.
2012-08-28 19:28:59	It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?
2012-08-28 19:51:14	I stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. -- @MittRomney
2012-08-28 19:56:21	.@BarackObama's Super PAC has continually called @MittRomney a murderer  http://t.co/5gOxonMZ  Ironic since Obama is destroying Medicare.

2012-08-28 20:47:27	I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
2012-08-29 13:06:59	.@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.

2012-08-29 19:01:49	I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!
2012-08-29 19:39:30	China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama  http://t.co/mV75eJFy  Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough.

2012-08-30 17:33:57	The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
2012-08-30 17:42:48	After four  years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP
2012-08-30 18:06:05	I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
2012-08-30 18:29:44	Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
2012-08-30 18:49:51	I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.

2012-08-31 13:17:11	Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this.

2012-09-04 19:48:58	Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
2012-09-04 19:51:51	The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
2012-09-04 19:56:41	Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us.
2012-09-04 20:15:18	With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary.
2012-09-04 20:23:48	NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?
2012-09-05 13:31:46	The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs &amp, trade during @BarackObama's term.
2012-09-05 13:36:57	OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!
2012-09-05 14:21:16	What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
2012-09-05 14:26:11	July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
2012-09-05 14:41:51	No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans http://t.co/tJPJqsBV  Big mistake!
2012-09-05 15:09:29	Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
2012-09-05 15:23:51	.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance.

2012-09-05 15:28:30	.@lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit--go back and fight.
2012-09-05 17:36:34	With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16T.

2012-09-06 17:59:56	The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting Four More Years. Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
2012-09-06 18:11:52	After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
2012-09-06 18:52:14	Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.

2012-09-11 18:20:20	Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media?
2012-09-11 18:40:14	84% of US troops wounded &amp, 70% of our brave men &amp, women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there.
2012-09-11 19:08:28	Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them?

2012-09-12 19:05:32	What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil.
2012-09-12 19:08:19	It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
2012-09-12 19:13:00	OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off.
2012-09-12 19:18:50	So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres. Morsi in the White House http://t.co/WKhZV1Op  but doesn't have time for @netanyahu?

2012-09-12 19:46:20	Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.

2012-09-12 20:16:48	I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
2012-09-12 20:20:46	Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter.
2012-09-12 20:39:56	Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.

2012-09-13 13:01:35	Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
2012-09-13 13:14:42	This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
2012-09-13 13:15:48	We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
2012-09-13 13:57:47	Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.

2012-09-13 16:59:19	Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
2012-09-13 17:10:04	Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
2012-09-13 17:13:27	With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
2012-09-13 17:15:03	What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
2012-09-13 17:29:01	The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
2012-09-13 17:48:02	I will be speaking Monday, September 24, (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
2012-09-13 17:50:22	Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
2012-09-13 18:21:26	It's Thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
2012-09-13 18:32:03	Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  http://t.co/yOw3U3ja
2012-09-13 18:40:21	.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama, who put these radicals in power, deserves blame.

2012-09-18 20:05:13	None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
2012-09-18 20:15:19	Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.

2012-10-08 18:54:50	A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://t.co/0acwArSn  Four more years?
2012-10-08 19:32:09	Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
2012-10-08 19:39:34	Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
2012-10-08 19:55:24	At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
2012-10-08 19:58:09	Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
2012-10-08 20:02:48	How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
2012-10-08 20:54:46	Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses http://t.co/A8UyBknk Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth
2012-10-09 14:04:51	Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.
2012-10-09 14:11:38	Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
2012-10-09 14:39:49	Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
2012-10-09 14:47:54	.@jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE.
2012-10-09 15:02:25	.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
2012-10-09 15:26:51	.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
2012-10-09 15:34:29	Greece should get out of the euro &amp, go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
2012-10-09 17:11:27	California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama.
2012-10-09 17:12:10	Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
2012-10-09 17:14:39	My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates, the real state of unemployment &amp, bias media http://t.co/p8U4JmYg
2012-10-09 17:23:10	Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also, not a pressure player.
2012-10-09 17:27:49	In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot.
2012-10-09 17:43:38	George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
2012-10-09 17:59:31	Donald Trump: ‘Monkey business’ on jobs http://t.co/JjVkVmNE via @politico
2012-10-09 18:29:15	When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly, after the election!
2012-10-09 18:37:12	Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.
2012-10-09 20:26:50	With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
2012-10-09 20:44:38	“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate.” - Think Like a Billionaire
2012-10-09 21:11:35	Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
2012-10-09 21:39:26	Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
2012-10-09 22:06:45	The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks...
2012-10-10 13:28:35	.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
2012-10-10 14:00:26	By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise.
2012-10-10 14:42:46	I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. -- Mitt
2012-10-10 14:53:49	I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
2012-10-10 15:34:38	Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!
2012-10-10 15:39:34	Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
2012-10-10 16:08:08	It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud!
2012-10-10 16:45:14	27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
2012-10-10 17:07:29	I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
2012-10-10 18:04:35	Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?
2012-10-10 18:49:02	47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
2012-10-10 18:51:53	DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking?
2012-10-10 19:20:14	Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
2012-10-10 19:25:15	Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding http://t.co/1XB8OK2t  Do people think this is fair?
2012-10-10 19:43:41	A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
2012-10-10 19:46:33	Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
2012-10-10 20:07:02	You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird.  -- @MittRomney
2012-10-10 20:15:51	I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
2012-10-10 20:20:54	Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China http://t.co/xRJlsxqB  Obama is killing investment.
2012-10-10 20:27:23	Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an A grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor.
2012-10-10 20:40:51	I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium &amp, waterfall.
2012-10-10 20:44:23	Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad http://t.co/VQI57pcd  Foreign candidate getting foreign donations.
2012-10-10 20:50:32	@usa67us  Thank you
2012-10-11 13:00:12	When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -- Henry Ford
2012-10-11 15:45:46	Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
2012-10-11 15:51:39	Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
2012-10-11 15:54:48	Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it mildly -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
2012-10-11 16:02:37	.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
2012-10-11 16:14:00	I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
2012-10-11 16:38:46	$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
2012-10-11 16:55:00	Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
2012-10-11 18:01:25	If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
2012-10-11 18:49:03	I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
2012-10-11 18:51:41	Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2
2012-10-11 19:31:16	Why the hell did we help the Libyan rebels in the first place. That is the real scandal.
2012-10-11 19:33:25	How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
2012-10-11 19:55:31	Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time
2012-10-11 19:57:16	Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history
2012-10-11 19:59:55	So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince http://t.co/6KErqMup  Sounds like his book bio!
2012-10-11 20:07:32	It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
2012-10-11 20:11:55	Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? http://t.co/upa00265 Who is this guy?
2012-10-11 20:15:02	Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data http://t.co/5wDEDsJZ
2012-10-11 21:15:25	.@Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here http://t.co/sP2DCsqI
2012-10-11 23:21:20	Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
2012-10-12 00:54:28	Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
2012-10-12 01:04:30	Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 01:13:21	Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 01:24:36	Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 01:29:31	Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 01:47:09	Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 02:39:37	Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
2012-10-12 10:56:51	Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
2012-10-12 12:52:50	British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp, environment destroying Scottish windmills.
2012-10-12 13:26:15	Wing bangers-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
2012-10-12 13:46:11	ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
2012-10-12 14:03:53	@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!
2012-10-12 14:28:23	There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt
2012-10-12 15:40:45	First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on compassionate grounds. Do you believe?
2012-10-12 16:55:11	Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
2012-10-12 17:05:08	Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate
2012-10-12 18:14:55	My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
2012-10-12 18:25:57	I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
2012-10-12 18:33:48	.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
2012-10-12 18:43:26	Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
2012-10-12 18:53:12	With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp, @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
2012-10-12 19:03:06	Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
2012-10-12 19:19:07	What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. --@PaulRyanVP
2012-10-12 19:35:38	Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
2012-10-12 19:53:01	I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
2012-10-12 20:09:06	When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
2012-10-12 20:23:40	Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- Warren G. Bennis
2012-10-13 00:22:12	I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
2012-10-13 14:14:01	When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say  what were we doing.
2012-10-13 15:13:11	Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
2012-10-13 15:28:00	I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
2012-10-13 15:38:01	Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
2012-10-13 17:38:31	They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
2012-10-13 18:40:53	Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.
2012-10-13 18:58:28	Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.
2012-10-13 21:11:13	Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
2012-10-14 01:34:34	So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
2012-10-14 13:09:24	A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
2012-10-14 13:39:39	.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
2012-10-14 14:09:32	Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
2012-10-14 16:42:17	A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
2012-10-14 16:44:38	Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
2012-10-14 18:26:20	Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win(Winning solves all problems- (cont) http://t.co/2rVgPfmo
2012-10-14 18:43:02	No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.
2012-10-14 18:43:44	I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
2012-10-15 01:40:17	.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.
2012-10-15 02:06:13	Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
2012-10-15 02:24:30	Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
2012-10-15 13:54:32	A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
2012-10-15 14:10:34	I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
2012-10-15 14:59:40	Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
2012-10-15 15:10:56	A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
2012-10-15 16:22:53	Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
2012-10-15 16:55:40	Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
2012-10-15 16:57:43	Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
2012-10-15 19:28:06	Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
2012-10-15 19:44:51	A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
2012-10-15 20:09:17	Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
2012-10-15 20:11:13	Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC
2012-10-15 20:37:35	Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications &amp, records
2012-10-15 20:41:12	If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!
2012-10-15 21:25:45	Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by.Donald J. Trump
2012-10-15 21:36:13	The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. -- @MittRomney
2012-10-16 00:48:35	Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
2012-10-16 13:08:30	Donald Trump's back with 14 'Apprentice' All-Stars http://t.co/Jhv9xFF9 via @AP
2012-10-16 13:10:45	Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go!
2012-10-16 13:23:01	@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!
2012-10-16 13:39:57	I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
2012-10-16 13:53:35	Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
2012-10-16 13:57:59	I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
2012-10-16 14:08:09	I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
2012-10-16 14:12:29	Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
2012-10-16 14:27:26	.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
2012-10-16 14:30:49	I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
2012-10-16 15:10:20	.@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.
2012-10-16 15:11:41	.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote &amp, make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
2012-10-16 15:37:45	Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
2012-10-16 16:21:53	Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
2012-10-16 17:01:30	It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
2012-10-16 17:47:29	The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
2012-10-16 17:50:34	Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
2012-10-16 17:54:47	.@History's wonderful The Men Who Built America with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate
2012-10-16 18:01:26	.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
2012-10-16 18:16:21	.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
2012-10-16 18:20:35	Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast &amp, Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.
2012-10-16 18:31:46	.@washtimes @BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America' http://t.co/CcRkSlHY
2012-10-16 18:47:13	I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
2012-10-16 18:49:05	Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
2012-10-16 19:23:56	Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
2012-10-16 20:11:35	.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp, transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
2012-10-16 20:44:55	@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
2012-10-16 20:57:46	Get ready for tonight!
2012-10-16 21:01:47	If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp, 7 so they will win!
2012-10-16 21:03:42	Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp, @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive.
2012-10-16 21:11:56	For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
2012-10-16 21:22:31	@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
2012-10-16 21:26:28	We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
2012-10-16 21:37:12	I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
2012-10-17 00:46:19	Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say let's get ready to rumble!
2012-10-17 01:07:13	Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
2012-10-17 01:07:29	Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
2012-10-17 01:09:27	Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
2012-10-17 01:13:17	Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
2012-10-17 01:25:53	.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
2012-10-17 01:26:42	Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
2012-10-17 01:37:49	Obama just said @MittRomney was a very successful investor--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
2012-10-17 01:43:29	Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
2012-10-17 02:12:13	Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
2012-10-17 02:12:24	Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
2012-10-17 02:17:33	.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
2012-10-17 02:23:05	Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
2012-10-17 02:31:46	You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
2012-10-17 02:50:09	Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate
2012-10-17 12:01:27	Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
2012-10-17 12:18:02	George Will said best debate he ever saw. If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
2012-10-17 12:26:39	Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
2012-10-17 13:45:42	Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
2012-10-17 13:51:03	At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago.
2012-10-17 13:54:31	Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
2012-10-17 13:54:51	I still love Derek, he is a winner!
2012-10-17 13:55:45	Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
2012-10-17 14:16:25	Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
2012-10-17 14:17:40	Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
2012-10-17 14:30:21	Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
2012-10-17 15:06:50	My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
2012-10-17 15:07:53	My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--&amp, all the biggies. It's like having your own newspaper.
2012-10-17 15:13:08	My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees &amp, how to terminate his contract http://t.co/dlErLZAE
2012-10-17 15:17:51	@marileenelson Thanks
2012-10-17 15:23:45	Via @espn: Donald Trump would fire A-Rod  http://t.co/kom7x1ZP
2012-10-17 15:26:05	Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
2012-10-17 15:32:12	Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVF
2012-10-17 15:32:59	Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp, environment of many countries &amp, communities.
2012-10-17 15:39:31	Remember, new environment friendly  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
2012-10-17 15:51:55	Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp, how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
2012-10-17 15:53:05	If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp, aesthetically.
2012-10-17 16:20:33	All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
2012-10-17 16:35:43	Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
2012-10-17 16:36:21	...Bad decisions can be devastating.
2012-10-17 16:39:20	Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media
2012-10-17 16:42:52	.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
2012-10-17 16:54:28	Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
2012-10-17 18:08:31	Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!
2012-10-17 18:11:24	While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC
2012-10-17 18:14:10	Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.
2012-10-17 18:30:13	@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
2012-10-17 18:32:55	Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
2012-10-17 18:35:11	Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
2012-10-17 18:40:15	Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
2012-10-17 18:47:19	Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp, will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
2012-10-17 18:54:24	Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
2012-10-17 19:06:32	What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
2012-10-17 19:47:48	.@dubephnx If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos &amp, replace it with junk that doesn't (cont) http://t.co/d10u18dh
2012-10-17 19:54:12	.@antbaxter should really be ashamed about his massive box office disaster. Take a hint and get out of the film (cont) http://t.co/qygbZxZZ
2012-10-17 20:00:26	.@mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back? He is back!
2012-10-17 20:09:53	If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
2012-10-17 20:12:45	Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10% http://t.co/1ZISkkn9  Obama did not tell truth last night.
2012-10-17 20:22:25	Major grudge match this weekend between @nyjets &amp, @Patriots. I have a dilemma, I am good friends w/ both Woody (cont) http://t.co/latxc1K9
2012-10-17 20:42:56	Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
2012-10-17 20:50:46	.@ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama.
2012-10-17 20:58:23	Great--now Supreme Court Justices are talking about a constitutional right to a cell phone http://t.co/6oXWvjnB Obama, just stop already.
2012-10-17 21:01:45	#SuccessByTrump, exclusively available @Macy's, has set sale records for fastest selling cologne. Makes a great gift http://t.co/Lr6ENhWA
2012-10-18 12:37:43	Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
2012-10-18 12:39:51	When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. --@MittRomney
2012-10-18 13:06:02	Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
2012-10-18 13:07:30	Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. Really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud--not possible!
2012-10-18 14:15:01	Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family &amp, the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner
2012-10-18 14:27:57	Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong?
2012-10-18 14:34:34	@jeff_coles  I will--thanks.
2012-10-18 14:36:24	@antbaxter @MailOnline  They only suffered by watching your 3rd rate documentary (which bombed).
2012-10-18 14:45:04	@womenzbinder Check the records, dummy--I was never a Bush II fan--he is why we have Obama!
2012-10-18 14:49:56	The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public, there is no bigger thrill than that. --Vince McMahon @WWE
2012-10-18 14:57:19	@loveandgarbage  Dopey--who went bankrupt, you? I never did.
2012-10-18 15:00:39	@PartyCoveMag @espn @politico @WSJ  Thanks!
2012-10-18 15:49:47	Newsweek ending print edition--sad. Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing--they lost all credibility. TIME to follow?
2012-10-18 15:57:41	A reader just sent me the following: I wanted to share with you something rather startling. On page 103 of (cont) http://t.co/1MzgzMrl
2012-10-18 16:16:08	@G_Harwood  Because they are either jealous or losers (or both).
2012-10-18 16:16:43	@darbizman  Thanks!
2012-10-18 16:21:53	Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
2012-10-18 16:39:34	I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however.
2012-10-18 16:41:47	Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.
2012-10-18 17:59:23	Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
2012-10-18 18:02:58	While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back!
2012-10-18 19:11:20	Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous.
2012-10-18 19:19:34	When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
2012-10-18 19:25:39	Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man.
2012-10-18 19:54:07	It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
2012-10-18 20:25:31	The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
2012-10-18 20:38:20	My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records--they are really phenomenal. You can order them at http://t.co/oeCVxEGZ
2012-10-18 20:42:09	@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister.
2012-10-18 20:44:35	@NeanderthalMan1 @MittRomney  I was referring, of course, to Bill Clinton's statement on the economy.
2012-10-18 20:52:30	@Morali_Arch Great to meet you also.
2012-10-18 20:54:19	@CalumSpence Greatly appreciated, thanks.
2012-10-18 20:55:43	@donmarie16  A total professional.
2012-10-18 20:57:11	@toddulu @Nationals I hope that's the reason--otherwise, just plain stupid.
2012-10-18 20:58:03	@YouthPastorDarr @seanhannity @megynkelly @JohnCena Good luck!
2012-10-18 20:59:18	@waycooljr37 @Nationals Bob Kraft &amp, Coach Bill are far too smart!
2012-10-18 21:06:18	Hey @Rosie--how is your recovery going? I hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon!
2012-10-18 21:09:04	@gastronome2  I love India!
2012-10-18 22:11:46	The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team?
2012-10-19 13:23:51	A penny saved is a penny earned. -- Benjamin Franklin
2012-10-19 13:43:43	Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election. Time certainly flies!
2012-10-19 13:56:38	I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
2012-10-19 14:25:33	@Rosie @realDonaldTrump  Thanks for the info Rosie--get well.
2012-10-19 14:46:27	.@evaemery Thanks--you sound great!
2012-10-19 15:30:03	.@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore!
2012-10-19 15:31:01	Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President!
2012-10-19 15:44:48	It is a great honor to have helped the community so much. http://t.co/ZC0boYWu
2012-10-19 15:46:15	With Barry Diller &amp, Tina Brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?
2012-10-19 15:47:09	Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell. I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall.
2012-10-19 15:53:32	@evaemery Never give up. You have what it takes.
2012-10-19 16:07:19	.@MittRomney did a great job last night. Watch the clip! http://t.co/a1muA6zj
2012-10-19 16:17:42	Obama said not optimal to Ambassador &amp, embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate.
2012-10-19 16:28:08	@MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree, but their careers weren't fueled by drugs.
2012-10-19 16:29:31	@JakfromBk Thanks!
2012-10-19 16:38:13	Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines? Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it!
2012-10-19 16:39:31	I guess they don’t have freedom of the press in Scotland. We created this ad and the ASA would not allow us to (cont) http://t.co/osKS2X87
2012-10-19 16:40:20	.@lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad!
2012-10-19 16:43:59	For the truth about job creation in America go to http://t.co/rc7isiPh  A great site for employers to get the tools &amp, information they need!
2012-10-19 16:44:52	Congratulations to Bernie Marcus &amp, Herman Cain @JobCreatorsUSA on the #TruthTour2012--All employers need to check this out!
2012-10-19 17:00:27	@D_Hastie @lancearmstrong  No, I said U.S. destroyed a once American icon
2012-10-19 17:05:31	So many tweets &amp, stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter-- the relationship will never be the same. It is permanently broken.
2012-10-19 18:03:09	Some of you were asking about the All-Star line-up for Celebrity Apprentice http://t.co/hvnHHs6G
2012-10-19 18:07:24	.@katyperry is no bargain but I don't like John Mayer--he dates and tells--be careful Katy (just watch!).
2012-10-19 18:09:38	My interview with @IngrahamAngle discussing the real unemployment number and how the 7.8% number is a fraud http://t.co/TgYWt4my
2012-10-19 18:56:55	@stu120 No, sadly, not even close!
2012-10-19 19:02:49	Via @CraveOnline: Donald Trump is NOT A-Rod fan http://t.co/DqcwMXk8
2012-10-19 19:15:31	Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
2012-10-19 19:17:34	Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
2012-10-19 19:23:03	Obama has called Libya attack a bump in the road and not optimal. Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!
2012-10-19 19:24:32	Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.
2012-10-19 19:33:23	@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great--her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25%
2012-10-19 19:34:57	@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp, worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio.
2012-10-19 19:37:35	I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
2012-10-19 19:47:52	A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
2012-10-19 19:50:00	Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
2012-10-19 20:17:07	Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.
2012-10-19 20:17:58	Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham.

2012-10-19 20:23:29	Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?  Sad!
2012-10-19 20:25:00	.@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them.
2012-10-19 20:25:53	Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later.
2012-10-19 20:28:45	No surprise, welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama. http://t.co/pHREg2Cj  He is the food stamp &amp, welfare king
2012-10-19 20:30:45	.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.  What a surprise!
2012-10-19 20:32:13	7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%
2012-10-21 00:24:11	Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
2012-10-21 00:24:41	Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past.
2012-10-21 00:25:47	Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
2012-10-21 14:45:56	Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
2012-10-21 17:38:18	The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
2012-10-21 22:35:51	Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic.
2012-10-22 14:01:42	They succeed, because they think they can. -- Virgil
2012-10-22 14:14:44	Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
2012-10-22 14:21:55	Derek, get well soon, the @Yankees need youl.
2012-10-22 14:25:11	I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
2012-10-22 14:36:38	Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community &amp, are very expensive &amp, unreliable.
2012-10-22 14:49:26	People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
2012-10-22 15:13:48	Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.
2012-10-22 15:29:21	Via @politico: Donald Trump claims Barack Obama bombshell http://t.co/7UZEL9a0
2012-10-22 16:10:49	Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose.
2012-10-22 16:19:32	Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
2012-10-22 16:29:35	.@Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.
2012-10-22 16:43:36	Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
2012-10-22 17:05:35	I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
2012-10-22 19:05:05	My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
2012-10-22 19:28:43	.@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you
2012-10-22 19:50:18	The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
2012-10-22 20:19:40	Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
2012-10-22 20:44:55	This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
2012-10-22 20:47:03	Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
2012-10-22 20:48:40	Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.
2012-10-22 21:07:19	Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
2012-10-22 21:10:33	I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
2012-10-22 21:21:02	Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
2012-10-22 21:35:14	Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!
2012-10-23 00:19:05	Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
2012-10-23 01:00:06	Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
2012-10-23 01:09:57	.@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
2012-10-23 01:12:16	Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
2012-10-23 11:12:41	I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
2012-10-23 11:13:17	Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
2012-10-23 11:14:46	The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
2012-10-23 12:58:40	70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.
2012-10-23 13:29:38	I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
2012-10-23 14:09:11	No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record.

2012-10-23 16:41:55	.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
2012-10-23 16:50:41	Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President.
2012-10-23 17:13:07	China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
2012-10-23 18:09:34	Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
2012-10-23 18:10:56	My announcement is tomorrow!
2012-10-23 18:18:11	Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
2012-10-23 18:30:48	Last night was the first time Obama said we instead of I in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
2012-10-23 18:45:09	Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert &amp, Kristen.I don't have time except to say Robert, drop her, she cheated on you &amp, will again!
2012-10-23 19:52:59	.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!
2012-10-23 20:38:06	Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated 'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters...
2012-10-23 20:38:33	...that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump...
2012-10-23 20:39:26	.@BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--&amp, yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.

2012-10-24 21:26:38	My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
2012-10-24 21:30:51	Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find &amp, put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
2012-10-24 21:32:04	Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
2012-10-24 21:38:51	I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama?
2012-10-24 21:41:13	RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records http://t.co/Cn8bn9LH #Election2012
2012-10-24 21:43:01	I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
2012-10-24 21:44:12	Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity.
2012-10-24 21:49:10	... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
2012-10-24 21:49:39	In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
2012-10-24 21:55:22	Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.

2012-10-25 17:01:58	I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
2012-10-25 17:52:46	.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great!
2012-10-25 17:56:24	@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
2012-10-25 17:58:07	What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
2012-10-25 18:07:33	@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting.

2012-10-25 20:15:11	For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.

2012-10-25 21:06:19	It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
2012-10-26 12:51:44	The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. --The America We Deserve
2012-10-26 13:55:39	Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
2012-10-26 13:57:14	Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
2012-10-26 14:02:49	Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
2012-10-26 14:05:22	....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
2012-10-26 14:05:28	Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain....

2012-10-26 14:43:49	@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide.
2012-10-26 14:44:38	@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.
2012-10-26 14:46:54	@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.

2012-10-26 18:36:57	Be careful of an Obama bomb to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do.
2012-10-26 18:45:58	Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?
2012-10-26 18:48:42	...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
2012-10-26 18:52:49	By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.
2012-10-26 19:15:55	Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
2012-10-26 19:36:46	Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun.

2012-10-28 14:14:36	A lot changed when David Letterman said  he was probably born in this country--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.

2012-10-30 13:39:39	I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
2012-10-30 14:05:10	Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
2012-10-30 14:06:18	Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.

2012-10-30 17:16:13	The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
2012-10-30 17:19:00	These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
2012-10-30 17:22:50	My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm http://t.co/Lz7tTurD
2012-10-30 17:24:07	My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama http://t.co/ebUofUW0
2012-10-30 17:32:36	Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes.
2012-10-30 17:44:25	I never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview
2012-10-30 17:45:59	Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. --Midas Touch
2012-10-30 17:49:58	How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
2012-10-30 17:51:39	Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
2012-10-30 18:08:43	Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!
2012-10-30 18:19:24	@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
2012-10-30 18:34:39	Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
2012-10-30 18:38:55	People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOl
2012-10-30 18:57:30	Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
2012-10-30 18:58:06	Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
2012-10-30 19:04:38	China’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses http://t.co/LfATjhuf Their market gains the day we are hit by storm
2012-10-30 19:07:22	Fans shouldn't worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.
2012-10-30 19:41:26	The polls &amp, momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!

2012-10-31 14:30:09	The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?
2012-10-31 14:32:57	I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
2012-10-31 14:34:11	Watch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency http://t.co/02ABDshA
2012-10-31 16:16:51	I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump.
2012-10-31 16:19:42	Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific. A champion!
2012-10-31 17:02:00	Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama, #TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets &amp, 57th st. crane http://t.co/AvLO9Inf

2012-10-31 17:17:50	.@oreillyfactor called me a master marketeer last night--I am not. I am a great builder--I build great things &amp, people come.
2012-10-31 18:27:21	An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel-  http://t.co/yt7LPuME A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon.
2012-10-31 19:00:16	Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star.
2012-10-31 19:05:26	How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. http://t.co/eXJyiGeB
2012-10-31 19:06:38	Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
2012-10-31 19:11:21	In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.
2012-10-31 19:14:10	.@Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides.  Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue.
2012-10-31 19:17:01	Looking at the figures and plans behind @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid @AOL (cont) http://t.co/rO04RZDP
2012-10-31 19:29:38	There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records.
2012-10-31 19:36:43	A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
2012-10-31 19:54:28	How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--&amp, his ratings stink. You'd think @HBO could do a lot better.

2012-10-31 20:01:15	Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver &amp, @NashuaTelegraph endorsements!
2012-10-31 20:40:52	Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.
2012-10-31 20:45:20	President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!
2012-10-31 20:46:11	President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
2012-10-31 20:53:06	A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
2012-10-31 20:57:59	Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
2012-10-31 21:01:13	@stass13 Thanks!

2012-11-01 14:08:46	From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
2012-11-01 14:13:39	Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane?
2012-11-01 14:23:22	Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories &amp, manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy!
2012-11-01 14:24:54	You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't.

2012-11-01 14:45:34	To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day.
2012-11-01 15:08:50	Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.
2012-11-01 15:12:27	Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
2012-11-01 16:00:16	President Obama missed the deadline!
2012-11-01 16:01:50	I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
2012-11-01 16:40:00	Press release. Video response to follow. http://t.co/3Xz74ipi
2012-11-01 17:11:46	My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency. http://t.co/oK9SpIc7
2012-11-02 13:56:04	If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
2012-11-02 13:57:19	Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
2012-11-02 14:13:19	Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
2012-11-02 14:14:04	What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
2012-11-02 14:37:21	How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
2012-11-02 14:46:04	I will start reviewing various political reporters etc &amp, websites as to their professionalism &amp, fairness—many people asking for this.
2012-11-02 14:55:13	Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
2012-11-02 15:33:03	It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
2012-11-02 15:35:09	With long gas lines &amp, total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama.
2012-11-02 15:45:15	.@Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
2012-11-02 15:46:19	We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
2012-11-02 15:50:10	.@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional.
2012-11-02 15:56:13	.@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it.
2012-11-02 16:20:16	.@TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted!
2012-11-02 17:06:11	I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island &amp, Long Island.
2012-11-02 17:15:32	People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
2012-11-02 17:19:44	Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
2012-11-02 17:46:48	How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
2012-11-02 18:23:04	Unemployment is now 7.9%.  Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad!

2012-11-02 18:39:09	A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation?
2012-11-02 18:44:08	I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck.
2012-11-02 18:56:04	Obama has destroyed the middle class.  In ’09, median household income was $55,198.  Now it is $50,678.  Four more years?
2012-11-02 18:59:25	Global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked http://t.co/5BeAhats

2012-11-02 19:44:39	Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012.  His promises are worthless!
2012-11-02 19:45:29	Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results.  They are praying Obama wins.
2012-11-02 19:46:12	Concerns over the national debt are stopping businesses from hiring and expanding http://t.co/nuzGMIkt Obama's policies are unsustainable
2012-11-02 19:53:02	Members from Obama's own job council are endorsing @MittRomney http://t.co/mYT6zbmi  Not surprising
2012-11-02 19:55:15	Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate.  Another 4 years of legislative stalemate.

2012-11-03 17:29:21	Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney. All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel?
2012-11-03 17:53:17	Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
2012-11-04 00:03:28	Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years??
2012-11-04 00:18:54	We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote.

2012-11-06 19:56:28	More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama. Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen
2012-11-06 19:57:14	Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. If you have any problems, notify the poll workers.
2012-11-06 20:01:15	Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ &amp, Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY &amp, NJ are still decimated by Sandy.  Wrong!

2012-11-06 20:27:21	Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 http://t.co/hy6O6r8F What took @CBS so long to release this footage?
2012-11-06 20:39:13	Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
2012-11-06 20:40:19	@Tappersong  Thanks Gary.
2012-11-06 20:42:39	The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.  There is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet.

2012-11-06 21:23:00	I love show Law and Order but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever. No talent--unwatchable!
2012-11-06 21:24:38	.@MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent--why did they ever put him on Law and Order?
2012-11-06 21:31:35	Whoever wins today, remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling. Our work is not done until America is strong again.

2012-11-07 04:18:10	Well, back to the drawing board!
2012-11-07 04:29:33	We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!
2012-11-07 04:30:51	Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
2012-11-07 04:33:02	This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
2012-11-07 04:39:32	Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble...like never before.
2012-11-07 04:43:19	Our nation is a once great nation divided!
2012-11-07 04:45:09	The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
2012-11-07 04:47:20	Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up!
2012-11-07 04:54:22	House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.

2012-11-07 17:16:19	Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news.
2012-11-07 17:17:55	Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. People will learn the truth! @NBCNightlyNews
2012-11-07 17:20:12	Brian, if I'm well past the last exit to relevance how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews
2012-11-07 17:25:09	This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow.

2012-11-07 20:52:35	Millions without electricity across NY &amp, NJ. The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
2012-11-07 20:56:54	Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost. What a waste of money.
2012-11-07 21:05:25	The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
2012-11-07 21:12:26	Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.

2012-11-08 16:08:25	Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy &amp, the death &amp, destruction it caused.
2012-11-08 16:38:15	...I  trounced him in ratings &amp, Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday. Brian—are you irrelevant?
2012-11-08 16:38:21	Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night, I was on last Thursday
2012-11-08 19:07:38	It is that time of the year.  The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.  The greatest ice rink in the country.
2012-11-08 19:11:08	Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
2012-11-08 19:24:55	I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
2012-11-08 19:40:39	I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!
2012-11-08 19:52:42	Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again http://t.co/v7RwPT0P Thanks for letting us know now
2012-11-08 20:12:25	No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
2012-11-08 20:42:42	.@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi.
2012-11-08 20:50:40	With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.
2012-11-08 21:19:07	At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!
2012-11-08 21:59:34	China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
2012-11-08 22:01:31	China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes http://t.co/oX6JYnqE  They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won't do anything.
2012-11-08 22:11:41	China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine http://t.co/QTYCvpUc  They will end up stealing the design from us as usual.

2012-11-08 22:52:33	Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
2012-11-09 14:55:33	Remember to watch the series finale of The Men Who Built America this Sunday at 8/7c on @History
2012-11-09 15:23:42	Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP &amp, glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.
2012-11-09 18:31:42	The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
2012-11-09 18:36:02	Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...I hope!
2012-11-09 18:49:55	I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help.
2012-11-09 18:57:05	I got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country!
2012-11-09 19:07:44	9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last &amp, yet the Republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong!
2012-11-09 19:23:22	@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxter—Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap &amp, boring documentary is a tremendous flop.
2012-11-09 19:30:11	Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!
2012-11-09 19:39:38	.@antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
2012-11-09 19:40:31	.@antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?
2012-11-09 19:41:48	.@antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof &amp, Aberdeen seeing big benefits.

2012-11-09 21:02:02	She’s baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it won’t help-- she’s got no talent &amp, no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
2012-11-09 21:02:50	Everybody wants me to talk about Robert Pattinson and not Brian Williams—I guess people just don’t care about Brian!

2012-11-10 14:56:25	Wow,  I never saw the Petraeus thing coming. A straight laced guy! Very sad for him and his family.

2012-11-12 20:37:50	No surprise that @BBC is in a major scandal for shoddy journalism.  Any network that air’s @antbaxter’s garbage has zero credibility.

2012-12-27 19:54:01	I hate hearing after all of the hard work that @MittRomney never wanted to become President.
2012-12-27 20:06:58	I told the Republicans the debt ceiling talks should come before election--&amp, we would have a Republican president—they wouldn’t listen.

2012-12-28 18:54:45	@Limka11 @Jess_Wiliem98  Thank you.
2012-12-28 19:01:28	The Republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling.  They can get everything they want.  Focus!
2012-12-28 19:24:59	Any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures, in baseline spending, so we can get our credit back.
2012-12-28 19:45:32	@Nicholas_Lipton  March 3rd.
2012-12-28 19:50:52	Obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year.

2012-12-28 20:45:15	Raising the capital gains tax in this fragile economic time is the dumbest thing Washington could do.  So they will probably do it.
