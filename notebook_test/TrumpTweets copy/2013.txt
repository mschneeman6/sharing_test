2013-01-01 15:20:23	Maybe Boehner will stop this one sided deal in the House...I hope so!
2013-01-02 14:56:09	This is a terrible deal for the country and an embarrassment for Republicans!

2013-01-02 19:23:18	...Remember--I told you so.
2013-01-02 19:23:37	Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
2013-01-02 19:27:07	This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.  It is pathetic.  Obama is laughing at them.

2013-01-07 19:29:38	Nominating Chuck Hagel for SOD is the wrong move for Obama.  He doesn’t need the fight.  Too much political capital will be wasted.

2013-02-25 00:12:46	@alexleiser33. Thanks Alex.
2013-02-25 01:33:41	Here we go with the Oscars!
2013-02-25 01:46:06	How do you like Seth and Oscars so far?
2013-02-25 01:50:53	I don't like the opening even a little bit!
2013-02-25 01:54:17	You are right-more like the opening of the Tonys.
2013-02-25 01:58:42	Django Unchained is the most racist movie I have ever seen, it sucked!
2013-02-25 01:59:55	Very tacky set!
2013-02-25 02:33:47	Shirley B did a very good job singing Goldfinger! Not easy.
2013-02-25 02:40:46	Lincoln never sounded like that!
2013-02-25 02:41:53	@ScottFlakne. Thanks Scott.
2013-02-25 03:35:19	Anne Hathaway is a good winner!
2013-02-25 03:42:34	Sorry, I never went bankrupt and don't wear a wig (it's all mine)!
2013-02-25 04:30:45	The Oscar broadcast is really boring - where is the glamour and beauty?
2013-02-25 04:39:57	Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas look great!
2013-02-25 05:07:16	I've had enough of this - good night!
2013-02-25 11:04:27	I'll be doing Fox and Friends this morning at seven.
2013-02-25 11:11:44	@5thmcfly. In April - thanks.

2013-02-25 14:10:56	...Overall, the Academy Awards were very average at best.
2013-02-25 14:11:00	Last night William Shatner had more airtime than any winner. It should have been called the William Shatner show...
2013-02-25 14:11:28	How did you like Michelle Obama’s bangs last night?
2013-02-25 16:19:06	Why do losers &amp, haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t. Like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters.
2013-02-25 16:23:41	Whenever one of the morons say I wear a wig, stop reading because they have no credibility &amp, just hate.
2013-02-25 16:35:16	@JUrciuoli19 Very good!

2013-02-25 16:49:51	People buy deals &amp, immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals..
2013-02-25 16:51:02	Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
2013-02-25 17:20:44	Speaker John Boehner, who I like, should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
2013-02-25 17:22:02	The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is, he can’t stand them!
2013-02-25 18:27:39	...So far, he has been a complete failure at doing so. He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
2013-02-25 18:28:06	An individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me.....
2013-02-25 18:52:46	.@MarissaMayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. She is doing a great job!
2013-02-25 18:54:34	@anchantra  Thanks--the big question is why!
2013-02-25 18:55:29	@JUrciuoli19  I will.

2013-02-25 20:58:06	Our leaders are terrible. The government spends over $50B a day.  It can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending?! Sad!

2013-02-26 18:03:07	Now I know that Yahoo is in good hands. It took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home.
2013-02-26 18:04:05	... Also, if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe).
2013-02-26 18:04:11	When employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group...
2013-02-26 18:07:56	..... I wonder if Angelo has a job or is on assistance. In any event, I'm sure he is a nice guy!
2013-02-26 18:08:05	A certain whack job, Go Angelo, who doesn't have a life- spends his time hopelessly attacking me re: Macy's....

2013-02-26 18:37:43	... and pay per view records with “Battle of the Billionaires” in Detroit. It was a wild day!
2013-02-26 18:37:46	One of the reasons, I assume, I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings...
2013-02-26 18:41:37	I will be on @LateNightJimmy tonight.  Always have a good time with @jimmyfallon.  Now we know he will get high ratings tonight.
2013-02-26 19:17:30	Country music star @TraceAdkins returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice.  Competing for @RedCross, Trace is great!

2013-02-27 22:03:36	How come nobody mentions that the Nielsen Ratings of the Apprentice, after 12 seasons-- as shown by Howard Stern --totally blow away...
2013-02-27 22:06:31	... Rove’s ad campaign has made Ashley Judd a totally credible candidate. Be careful Mitch!
2013-02-27 22:06:34	If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election, he’d better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast...
2013-02-27 22:07:16	Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given her—unreal!—how stupid can we get?
2013-02-27 22:11:31	Karl Rove’s stupid ad made Ashley Judd hot—now everybody is talking about her.

2013-03-29 16:03:15	This week’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC features another memorable Board Room rumble between @piersmorgan &amp, @OMAROSA.
2013-03-29 16:43:26	Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.
2013-03-29 16:46:40	Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. They have an obligation to best themselves.
2013-03-29 17:12:44	Find out who and what is the best in your field. Identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. Learn the standards they follow.
2013-03-29 18:10:03	Have a great Good Friday and a Happy Easter.
2013-03-29 21:37:05	@nikkio: @realDonaldTrump Just read book Contagious, why things catch on - reminded me of u --ur one of a kind! :)   Thank you!
2013-03-29 23:16:52	Current @NYMag really sad, not only boring but highly inaccurate. Use better paper product - looks like a death march (which it is!).

2013-03-30 09:24:46	@gramma421   Not recent, long term support for the autism community.
2013-03-30 09:33:04	@tonyantoine321: @realDonaldTrump Great advice. Yesterday, I listened to your audio book Think Big for the 2nd Time. Great!
2013-03-30 09:47:31	@Thaddalicious: @realDonaldTrump should be president, he knows what he is talking about #rolemodel  Thank you!
2013-03-30 11:33:42	North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.
2013-03-30 11:42:50	What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING!
2013-03-30 11:47:45	@kaiser1859: @realDonaldTrump what is the solution Mr Trump? LEADERSHIP!
2013-03-30 19:04:03	@thejbrain: @realDonaldTrump Very well said. The United States needs people like you to show what truly leadership means! So true!
2013-03-30 19:29:54	@SullyThinks: why is @realDonaldTrump not the president of the US right now?! A very good question!
2013-03-30 19:43:06	We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
2013-03-30 21:30:35	China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
2013-03-30 21:47:08	Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays.
2013-03-30 22:00:23	@KimStagliano: @realDonaldTrump When will NYT write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here, Mr. Trump. They should Kim!
2013-03-30 22:08:46	No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad.

2013-04-21 13:26:58	I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
2013-04-21 13:32:51	The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
2013-04-21 13:40:45	I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as the suspect.
2013-04-21 13:52:17	When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings
2013-04-21 13:56:48	Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
2013-04-21 14:05:47	I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
2013-04-21 14:11:24	You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!

2013-04-21 15:34:19	Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
2013-04-21 15:38:07	Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!
2013-04-21 15:47:49	NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
2013-04-21 15:55:45	If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
2013-04-21 20:57:20	Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!
2013-04-21 21:00:28	I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
2013-04-21 21:04:18	Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
2013-04-21 21:34:49	Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, speak to my lawyers.
2013-04-21 21:46:19	What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!

2013-04-29 01:04:52	Here’s @Joan_Rivers. She &amp, @IvankaTrump make a terrific team as my advisors. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:07:31	Do you think @THEGaryBusey will be able to “step up” as PM?  I know @lisarinna is hoping so. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:11:38	.@THEGaryBusey doesn’t need instructions. Couch time is more fun. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:21:33	Looks like Plan B is stuck with the mechanical dog. @THEGaryBusey has latched on and won’t let go. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:27:30	.@THEGaryBusey feels he’s been abandoned by his team. Do you think so? #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:37:14	.@TraceAdkins says @Joan_Rivers is a gem. I agree. We all agree. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 01:51:06	.@IvankaTrump is right—Plan B has descended into a state of total chaos. #CelebApprentice

2013-04-29 02:18:52	Great memory @TheRealMarilu! #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 02:31:50	Maybe @THEGaryBusey should stick to words... vs. barking. He’s got a definite talent when he wants to use it. #CelebApprentice
2013-04-29 02:41:53	Do you agree with the client's decision? #CelebApprentice

2013-04-29 20:14:20	.@DannyZuker I'm in front of the camera and behind the camera- just looked at your picture, you'll never be in front of the camera!
2013-04-29 20:15:20	One hit wonder @DannyZuker, I notice you are not disputing all of the failures that I said you had. Let's talk about it!
2013-04-29 20:16:02	.@DannyZuker Don't lie, @ApprenticeNBC was #1 in all major demos at 10. Do not lie!
2013-04-29 20:41:27	I just sent @THEGaryBusey a check of $20,000 for his charity, Children's Kawasaki Disease . He worked hard and deserves it.

2013-05-11 21:10:29	The Apprentice, on the other hand, has been a MAJOR television hit, often times finishing #1. Even now, after 13 seasons, it wins its slot!

2013-05-11 21:35:03	@mikeluis93 Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts. No strength!

2013-05-24 20:06:25	@A11_Seeing_Eye: @realDonaldTrump @DAM615 Does an IQ of 60 count as being smart? No, sadly you are very dumb-but probably born that way.
2013-05-24 20:17:03	@ForQ2  Are you making less than minimum wage, don't worry, the government will protect you. Afraid to give your real name? You should be.
2013-05-24 20:18:13	@MaasMaasWhatup: Nobody does the Twitter thing quite like @realDonaldTrump. That man engages his critics like nobody I've seen before.  T.

2013-05-24 23:48:50	No @DannyZuker , just the opposite, lots of money can go to charity if you have the guts to play the game (deal)!
2013-05-24 23:57:49	@DannyZuker @AndyRichter Danny, you're not having fun, you are getting your ass kicked - afraid to make the deal?

2013-05-25 13:10:37	The lawyer I just beat in Chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @DannyZuker. Come on Danny, make the bet!
2013-05-25 13:20:40	If @DannyZuker competed against me and.won (which not too many people do), he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity!
2013-05-25 13:29:55	Come on @DannyZuker, take the bet, show your friends and family (&amp, your bosses on Modern Family) that you're not chicken shit

2013-06-05 02:29:03	@charleyUfarley   Innocent of what, weren't they brutally mugging people in the Park that night? The City better not settle this case!
2013-06-05 06:57:57	@gohermie: @realDonaldTrump @usopengolf Thank you Mr. Trump, I appreciate all of the support you have given me. I hope you can come watch.
2013-06-05 07:11:12	I will be going to Aberdeen, Scotland today to help my team celebrate the great success of Trump International Golf Links-press conference.
2013-06-05 07:28:16	My son @EricTrump has just done another great event and raised a lot of money for @StJude. He is a really good boy who loves helping kids.
2013-06-05 07:38:12	Thanks to @johnrich for putting on such a great concert fot @Stjude. John was a winner on Celebrity Apprentice and is a fantastic guy.
2013-06-05 07:55:28	According to Bill O'Reilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics, that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.
2013-06-05 08:05:30	Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
2013-06-05 08:12:52	When it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
2013-06-05 08:24:47	Likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now!
2013-06-05 08:27:36	@dblsolo700: @zed_crtr @realDonaldTrump ASK HIM ABOUT #CP5 CENTRAL PARK 5  Yea, ask me about the muggers!
2013-06-05 09:00:47	@dblsolo700  Not concerned about them-weren't they brutally mugging people in the Park?  Go check your facts.
2013-06-05 09:03:07	@an2nym: @realDonaldTrump Good luck. If I had known Id have come to shake your hand. Fab job in Aberdeen.
2013-06-05 09:07:23	@Strange_Drugs: @realDonaldTrump when you die in 4 or 5 years, the world will be a better place.  I know, I will make it that way!
2013-06-05 09:08:47	@NCartagena27: @realDonaldTrump I'm Puerto Rican and I agree with this. We need to stop trying to be so politically correct.
2013-06-05 10:33:16	@go_onrob   The show is a joke in comparison to the original Apprentice, but it does pay me a lot of money.
2013-06-05 12:14:32	I can't believe the Yankees continue to pay A Rod - they have a perfect right to stop paying (and should have stopped a long time ago).
2013-06-05 12:18:56	George Steinbrenner would have done a major number on A Rod - there is no way he would have gotten paid, even with the help of the union!
2013-06-05 12:20:40	@elamenwalker: @realDonaldTrump seen you speak at Charlotte Nc (ACN) that was awesome!  Thank you, a great audience.

2013-08-25 19:34:19	Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!
2013-08-25 19:42:09	Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
2013-08-25 19:47:44	Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also, recent asks?
2013-08-25 19:50:52	How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!

2013-08-30 18:11:30	@dhfr64 Happy Birthday Deborah.
2013-08-30 19:10:22	The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC, a sad and pathetic show, are way down. If they fired racist moron @Toure, a truly stupid guy, they live!
2013-08-30 19:17:42	Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing!
2013-08-30 19:26:45	If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad!
2013-08-30 21:28:39	How bad has our leader made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.
2013-08-30 21:30:00	@jenconservative: @realDonaldTrump Not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war!!  So true!
2013-08-30 21:33:35	@OneMikex: @realDonaldTrump he's to soft of a president  Incompetent would be a better word!
2013-08-30 21:35:41	@leebandoni: @realDonaldTrump for once the UK has seen sense and not been dragged into this. They were, for once, very smart!
2013-08-30 21:40:39	@kswizzle43: @realDonaldTrump what would you do - give a solution vs being so critical?.!.  I would make America great again!
2013-08-30 21:41:59	@jaymiller283: @realDonaldTrump @jenconservative We need a strong minded POTUS in office before we enter into another war.
2013-08-30 21:43:10	@jenconservative: @RKDrake @realDonaldTrump I would be totally surprised if the US even HAS any money to spend on Syria!! We don't!
2013-08-30 21:45:16	@kingsfansouth: @realDonaldTrump I usually agree with you, not tonight. Stop criticizing The President.I will when he makes good decisions
2013-08-30 21:48:47	@Joe1sPro: @realDonaldTrump the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly  But the so called rebels may be just as bad (or worse)!
2013-08-30 22:51:08	@cadams2513: @realDonaldTrump if trump was POTUS we would have all the money we need! #trump 2016 That's true!
2013-08-30 23:02:31	The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
2013-08-31 09:09:25	For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
2013-08-31 09:17:35	Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing!
2013-08-31 09:19:54	@JSDub901: @realDonaldTrump may be many things, but one thing he is, is right. #tellsitlikeitis Thank you (sort of).
2013-08-31 09:31:18	Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR
2013-08-31 09:37:35	Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him don't do it. He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
2013-08-31 09:43:15	China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-&amp, laugh at us!
2013-08-31 09:46:07	Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.
2013-08-31 09:47:36	@JesseNicholas13: @realDonaldTrump I'm scared for my future.  You should be!
2013-08-31 09:54:05	@jayneg53: @realDonaldTrump can't say Obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war!  General Patton would not be happy right now!
2013-08-31 09:55:36	@AveyahDoesWatch Thank you.
2013-08-31 10:00:12	Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP.
2013-08-31 11:49:20	@PolitixChick: Just from reading his tweets, it seems like @realDonaldTrump could run our country much better than our President right now.
2013-08-31 11:54:16	@danconiapm: @realDonaldTrump he's no Churchill. He might not even be Jimmy Carter!
2013-08-31 11:54:36	@dickquinn: @realDonaldTrump Obviously amateur hour at the WH. Obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so.
2013-08-31 11:57:12	@iRazaAliShah: @realDonaldTrump - Donald you are anti-Obama no matter what Obama does, you will take the opposite view.  WRONG-all on merit
2013-09-01 03:52:39	@jonathanagin: @realDonaldTrump wondering if u know or care that tomorrow begins childhood cancer awareness month.

2013-09-01 10:41:05	@Timi_fel: @realDonaldTrump You always have something negative to say about Obama ,dont you?  Yes!
2013-09-01 10:42:42	@BrandiHarmon Good luck.
2013-09-01 10:48:29	President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!
2013-09-01 10:49:20	@Illuminati6sep: @realDonaldTrump , you should be President . Save America  Thank you!
2013-09-01 10:51:56	@akmackey So true!
2013-09-01 10:57:02	It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now!
2013-09-01 10:57:53	@rick_huebner: @realDonaldTrump My son Joey survived leukemia. He is is now 13. Thank you Make-a-Wish and NCCF for everything they did.
2013-09-01 11:04:21	@imanthonyholmes: I've always looked up to @realDonaldTrump. Business and Politics! He's the man!  Thank you!
2013-09-01 11:09:11	@mguarino64: @realDonaldTrump  How would you treat the Syria situation if president ? I'd let them all fight with each other-focus on US!
2013-09-01 11:10:30	@Madrina26: @realDonaldTrump Any chance you'll change your mind and run for President? #GotMyVote  Time will tell!
2013-09-02 02:15:19	The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid
2013-09-02 02:20:29	Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
2013-09-02 02:27:10	We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared!
2013-09-02 02:28:40	@SwagDaddyYol0: Why isn't @realDonaldTrump president instead of Obama ??  That is truly a good question!
2013-09-02 02:31:13	@bdeal10: @realDonaldTrump you should be our next President. This country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012!True
2013-09-02 02:31:37	@libertybellskp: @realDonaldTrump That's the plan. Have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life? I am stunned daily.
2013-09-02 02:40:31	In war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing.
2013-09-02 02:48:59	@tkeller316  Thanks!
2013-09-02 05:42:31	@DanScavino: @realDonaldTrump - it's so bad there are actually maps of targets now in #Syria &amp, where USA ships would attack from.
2013-09-02 21:05:33	@mikethoms85: @realDonaldTrump with all due respect, Bush did exactly the same thing in Iraq.  You will seldom see me defending Bush.
2013-09-02 22:31:59	@schulesix3: Roast of @JamesFrancoTV will be the best one since @realDonaldTrump  OK, as long as mine remains number one!
2013-09-02 22:34:07	@53andlex: @realDonaldTrump, please run for POTUS 2016. America desperately needs a TRUE leader with common sense! Thank you.
2013-09-02 22:55:44	@EGSIV: @ArsenioHall actually @realDonaldTrump should be a first guest to show #gratitude #class Thanks for your nice remark!
2013-09-02 23:32:12	Each time I see one of Anthony Weiner's television ads for mayor I ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money &amp, time-go get a job!
2013-09-02 23:38:13	Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. Thrown out of politics and off of TV, CRAZY!
2013-09-02 23:39:40	@EwudziYamoah: @realDonaldTrump Glad to find you thank you for your philanthropic work,  Thank you!

2013-09-02 23:47:41	@ArsenioHall After Arsenio won Celebrity Apprentice he told me, in tears, that I would be his first guest if he got a show. No interest!
2013-09-02 23:49:37	@DeadlyKittenz: @realDonaldTrump when you are president will you be able to bring back hope, jobs, and cash? #trump2016  We have no choice

2013-09-03 01:11:39	Our country is looking very bad right now!
2013-09-03 01:55:06	If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay. Stay away and fix broken U.S.
2013-09-03 01:58:38	Think of it, the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work. How stupid!
2013-09-03 01:59:55	@Devante4Liberty: @realDonaldTrump But if we had a Republican President you would say the exact opposite right?  Wrong!
2013-09-03 11:14:35	@Trill_Blowa: If the government just listened to @realDonaldTrump this country would be so much better!
2013-09-03 11:28:44	President Obama's Arab Spring is not looking so good right now!
2013-09-03 12:32:13	@thobane63: @realDonaldTrump why the hell are you always criticising Obama  Because he is doing a terrible, in fact embarrassing, job!

2013-09-04 01:52:00	The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info &amp, time to prepare.
2013-09-04 02:00:07	What I am saying is stay out of Syria.
2013-09-04 02:12:16	For all of those fools that want to attack Syria, the U.S.has lost the vital element of surprise-so stupid-could be a disaster!
2013-09-04 02:14:44	@atkins4: @realDonaldTrump you realize that is what Iran wants, dont you? You beat Iran in a much different fashion-not through Syria!

2013-09-05 11:07:34	President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly, now he denies he said that!
2013-09-05 11:13:51	The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A.

2013-09-06 01:39:30	@vindictivraider: @realDonaldTrump Well quit yapping about and run for office. I like your ideas. DO IT!!
2013-09-06 12:35:12	Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what, when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack. Far too late!
2013-09-06 12:47:03	We don't have the leadership, including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it.
2013-09-06 12:55:26	Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.
2013-09-06 13:02:13	I wonder how much our leaders have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse?
2013-09-06 13:20:52	I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. We need real leadership, and fast,before it is too late

2013-09-07 12:33:40	Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas! A polititian's war.
2013-09-07 12:36:39	Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States!
2013-09-07 12:48:29	I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush-he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc.). In fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama!

2013-09-10 20:48:46	Danger-Weiner is a free man at 12:01AM. He will be back sexting with a vengeance. All women remain on alert.
2013-09-10 20:52:05	@Universifize @IvankaTrump @EricTrump It will be great &amp, produce many jobs.
2013-09-10 20:54:11	@AustinOdusanya1 @realDonaldTrump you are a great mentor. I have all your books  Great--good luck!
2013-09-10 23:09:11	The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!
2013-09-10 23:11:19	@VDIT13: @realdonaldtrump You are a great American!! Thanks from a Vietnam vet!
2013-09-10 23:25:51	This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad. President in trouble!
2013-09-10 23:27:15	Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
2013-09-11 00:17:08	@ASBrowntown: .@realDonaldTrump you want to send more Americans out to war? Why don't you sign up?  I am against an attack on Syria dummy!
2013-09-11 00:17:34	@JayLefler: @realDonaldTrump Putin is much smarter than Obama. No surprise his tactics.
2013-09-11 00:19:18	@kevin47881: @realDonaldTrump The 0bama presidency has been a disaster for America
2013-09-11 00:21:25	@d18mt2: @realDonaldTrump You will knock the President anyway. Wrong, I would love to see him do a great job, but it's not working that way
2013-09-11 00:24:40	@edbaram13: @realDonaldTrump everything you say is true and I respect you because your not afraid to say it
2013-09-11 00:26:54	@obamafraudulent: @realDonaldTrump @d18mt2 The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is a computer generated forgery.

2013-09-11 00:29:14	@allen1006: @realDonaldTrump @kevin47881 he has kept his campaign pledge to fundamentally transform America-for the worse!
2013-09-11 00:36:26	@JcoyShox25: I honestly think our next president should be @realDonaldTrump .. People can say what they want but dude seems to have it.
2013-09-11 00:39:09	Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
2013-09-11 01:01:39	Here we go!
2013-09-11 01:06:45	Does he look sharp, smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium, making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
2013-09-11 01:07:55	Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
2013-09-11 01:12:09	Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
2013-09-11 01:13:57	@bingham_tammy: @realDonaldTrump why wasn't Obama more concerned w/Benghazi #americans killed. Syria not our business
2013-09-11 01:17:03	He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
2013-09-11 01:25:27	We will have to see what Russia's next move will be. They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
2013-09-11 01:32:58	Bottom line, I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that!
2013-09-11 03:31:37	Wow, Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
2013-09-11 03:43:13	@MiketheScrew: @realDonaldTrump Give credit where it is due. NYC voters chose correctly.
2013-09-11 03:45:18	@TVreporter: @realDonaldTrump What will you miss most about Wiener?  Absolutely nothing!
2013-09-11 03:50:52	I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner, and both lost. For a while, when Spitzer was way up, it seemed that I was a lone voice! Good power
2013-09-11 04:15:06	Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer. Remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!
2013-09-11 04:16:00	@Brock2120: @realDonaldTrump I remember when Schneiderman was 2nd in command to Patterson on the D side. Can you believe those two?

2013-09-11 05:53:16	Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of us,then sued for $40 million.Dopey guy!
2013-09-11 05:53:43	Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose. He goes after a school with a 98% approval rating,leaves biggies alone
2013-09-11 10:24:33	@Airmanfirst: @realDonaldTrump Think Weiner will move to a state that doesn't know him? He should move, better for him to make a new start
2013-09-11 10:26:48	@thorpe81: @realDonaldTrump you are the greatest.. Thank you. #staygreat!  I will be working hard on that!
2013-09-11 10:39:14	The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
2013-09-11 10:46:09	Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. The so-called rebels must be thoroughly confused!
2013-09-11 10:48:01	Assad hit the jackpot!
2013-09-11 11:10:49	Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner
2013-09-11 11:12:59	@johndoe5210: @realDonaldTrump . I worked for another self made man, Elon Musk. I have the greatest respect for both of you. Thank you!

2013-09-11 12:50:32	@redellis1: @realDonaldTrump He must go... People like him r destroying our country and our principals!  Re lightweight A.G. Schneiderman
2013-09-11 12:51:25	Spitzer and Weiner lost, lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the PRIMARY. He has done a really poor job!
2013-09-11 13:04:22	I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. I fought him when others retreated out of fear. NEVER GIVE UP!
2013-09-11 13:11:52	Putin is having such a good time. Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. Do not fear,we are a NATION OF POTENTIAL
2013-09-11 13:19:54	Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems. Forget Syria and make America great again!
2013-09-11 16:26:37	@AccountsRS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for saving new york from another Spitzer era.  We got lucky!

2013-10-07 18:32:44	Obama is tougher on WWII vets wanting to visit a DC memorial than Iran. He needs to show respect to our vets and not play games.
2013-10-07 19:58:43	83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. Room for cuts.

2013-10-26 15:24:11	At this point the legacy of the Obama Administration will be, sadly, that of THE GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT - what a pathetic mess!
2013-10-26 19:18:17	Isn't it amazing that the U.S. and NSA can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get O's records!

2013-11-07 02:07:48	When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie-even the Senate Democrats are angry with him!
2013-11-07 02:13:19	Just sit back and watch, ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. The website is the best part of this mess!
2013-11-07 02:23:58	She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec.Sebelius. She has done great harm to many people and must be fired. Incompetent!

2013-11-07 11:21:33	Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years!
2013-11-07 11:27:36	A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship.
2013-11-07 11:35:54	If Democrats do not start opposing ObamaCare, and fast, Republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 - far greater than any predictions!

2013-11-16 12:19:41	The real J.P.Morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes. A settler is a soft target

2013-11-17 23:31:48	I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?

2013-11-17 23:40:09	The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
2013-11-18 10:16:53	Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.

2013-11-22 01:23:32	Weak newscasters are asking is there a racial component to knockout attacks? Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!

2013-11-23 12:36:44	The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head!

2013-11-24 01:16:05	The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!
2013-11-24 01:23:59	They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working!
2013-11-24 23:29:08	What a rotten deal we made with Iran. We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). They get everything, including delay and big cash!

2013-11-25 01:23:08	How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent   leader - ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals. JUST NEVER ENDS
2013-11-25 04:18:35	We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. WHY?
2013-11-25 04:24:53	Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback. Good game- not over yet!

2013-11-25 10:49:43	John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one
2013-11-25 10:55:25	The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side
2013-11-25 11:01:04	I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

2013-11-25 19:43:39	Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that.

2013-11-27 05:02:09	President Obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, PERIOD! This turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.
